    "# **The Healthy Breakfast Challenge**\n",
    " As a nutritionist, you have been hired by local schools to improve the breakfast habits of students. Recent studies have shown that having a nutritious breakfast greatly improves students' energy levels, concentration, and overall performance in school. However, the market is flooded with a variety of cereal brands, each claiming to be the best choice. With the goal of maximizing nutritional value, you need to make informed decisions on which cereal brand to recommend to the local schools.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Overview of your Mission**\n",
    " - **Milestone 1: Data Cleaning** <br> First up, you will dive into the cereal dataset. Just like detectives, you'll need to understand and clean this data. This means identifying and fixing any mistakes. This ensures you will be working with reliable data. <br>\n",
    " - **Milestone 2: Data Visualization** <br> With our data cleaned, it's time to create graphs to show the relationship between different nutritional elements in cereals.\n",
    " - **Milestone 3:Data Interpretation** <br> Finally, you need to interpret your findings. This is where you will make sense of your graphs, and will have found the best three cereals to recommend to local schools."

    "1. **Spot the clues:** First, scan through the cereal dataset for any bizzare entries. Are there any cereals with missing information? Are there numbers that just don't make sense?\n",
    "2. **The Clean-up:** Once you identify the bizzare entries, you can start the clean-up process. This can include filling in missing data, correcting inaccuracies, or even removing entries that just don't fit. You may need to research the cereal brand to input the correct data.\n",
    "3. **Final Inspection:** Take one last look at the cereal dataset so you don't miss anything."
